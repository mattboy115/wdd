1. Since my last stand-up I have become more confident about the object of the assignment. When I started I wasn't quite clear on what we were supposed to do.

2. This week I will apply the feedback the instructor gave for last week's assignment. I'm going to watch the videos in the turorial activity, paying extra attention to the ones related to the componenets I've chosen for my project. Then I will begin work on making my componenets.

3. This week will be the same as last week. I have very little time to myself to devote to my research. That's my problem. And there is nothing I can do about it. I can't make a schedule because every moment is unpredictable. I have to squeeze it in where I can. That's what holds me back. Other than that, nothing!
