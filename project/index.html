				Hello, my name is Matt. I enjoy developing web pages. Especially when it presents a challenge to me or makes me do something I've never done before. I'm always open to new experiences and concepts. This site is my way of showing what I have learned and what I need help with.

				<h4>WHAT I HOPE TO PRACTICE/LEARN</h4>
				<p>
					I have always had a lot of trouble with nav bars. They would never format right and I'd have a lot of trouble with their margins and padding and end up with a really messed up piece of garpage. I'd have to start over. Then when I started trying to make them with dropdowns using CSS it only got worse because then the dropdowns wouldn't work and when I got them to work, it wouldn't be possitioned right. I had to use my own tricks to get those things to work right. Then I learned how to use jQuery to make even better dropdowns a lot easier. But now I am hoping to unlearn all the bad practices I was using before.

				<h4>HOW THIS RELATES TO WHAT I HAVE/WILL LEARN IN WDD.</h4>
				<p>
					Adding dropdowns to a navigation menu has a great deal to do with WDD. A navigation bar is the user's main way to get around a website. Adding expanding menues also expands the user's options as far as places they can get to from where they are.
