1. Answer 4 Questions

1. What am I good at? I think I have a good balance of skills in both coding and design and I'm really good with graphics as well.

2. How do I perform? I perform while listening to focus music on Spotify in a quiet room. That's not a luxury I get all the time so when I do I don't waste it.

3. I value being able to solve a problem that has frustrated me for hours. The satisfaction that comes from figuring out a problem with the simplest solution that for some reason escapes me is the best feeling ever.

4. You can expect me to deliver my very best and nothing less.

2. I'm going to take a long hard look at the new information and think about how to apply it to the information I already know. This week is going to be the beginning of one of my biggest projects yet, I can tell.

3. One thing that is bothering me is some of the vague requirements of the project this week. Do we just have to have a page with the elements listed? How creative should we get with the design? What does it mean by "Blog of components"? Do we have to use a database to make the posts in that blog? How do we identify our components? Just label them?
